## So, you want to help build this tool?

1. Check the present release goals. These goals will be found in the [Trello](https://trello.com/b/iuvMQv9b/open-graph-book) which will show which features that we are targeting for this release, which ones are presently being worked on, and which ones have been completed. 
  * If there is a feature that you're interested on working with, but isn't part of this current release goals, document it as appropriate

2. If there is a goal you're interested in working with:
  1. Clone this project
  2. Branch off of the releases master branch. If a branch doesn't already exist for that goal, feel free to make one Features, Bugfixes, or other changes need to exist as their own branch. E.g. `feature-ExportBook`

3. Write failing unit tests as appropriate.
4. Write enough code to make those tests pass. (we will not accept requests that make our testing suite cry)
6. If appropriate, write corresponding behavior tests that we should expect from the browser.
7. Write enough code to make those tests pass. (we will not accept requests that make our testing suite cry)
8. Spend a reasonable amount of time to think about your solution and refactor it.
9. Lint your solution and make sure the linter doesn't complain (we will not accept requests that make the linter cry)
10. When the feature/bugfix/other is finished, rebase the branch off of the releases current master and submit a pull request.
  * Communication will take place on the request itself.
11. Have a beer!
